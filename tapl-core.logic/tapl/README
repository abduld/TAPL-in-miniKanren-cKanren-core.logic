# tapl

FIXME: TAPL using Clojure, core.logic, and core.match

## Usage

From the 'tapl' directory, use Leiningen to get the dependencies (you have installed Leiningen, right?):

    lein deps

To run the tests, just type:

    lein test

To play with the code in a REPL, type this in your terminal:

    lein REPL

which should give you something like this:

    Williams-MacBook-Air:tapl webyrd$ lein repl
    REPL started; server listening on localhost port 3224
    user=> 

and then import tapl, core.logic, and core.match by tying (or pasting) this at the REPL:

    (ns tapl-repl
      (:use [tapl.core])
      (:refer-clojure :exclude [==])
      (:use [clojure.core.logic])
      (:use [clojure.core.match :only [match]]))

Now you should be ready to test the tapl code:
      
    tapl-repl=> (run 10 [q] (T q))
    (:true :false :zero [:succ :true] [:succ :false] [:if :true :true :true] [:succ :zero] [:if :true :true :false] [:pred :true] [:if     :true :true :zero])
    tapl-repl=>
